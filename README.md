OVERVIEW
--

There are three parts to this

1. latticeAnalyser aka The Lattice Analyser: This analyses the positions and angular velocities of the dipoles and controls the noise current accordingly to simulate temperature.

2. temperature aka Temperature: This is the hardware for getting the right currents to flow at the right times, to get the temperature up and running.

3. holyText aka The Documentation: Well this is supposedly where I will make whatever presentations etc. for this project. So should be good eventually!
