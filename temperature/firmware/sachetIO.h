/*
	filename: sachetIO.h
	description: Header for breaking down a large chunk of data into regular sachets for transfer over communication channels.
	language: C
	For use with C++, use 
		extern "C" {#include "sachetIO.h"} 
	in your C++ program. C was chosen to provide compatibility with microcontrollers that don't support C++.

	The protocol is simplistic and assumes all data consistency is done during the transmission and reception of the sachets.
	There's a start seq and an end seq and data in between. 
	The library provides methods to encode, viz convert data to sachets and decode, viz combine sachets to recover data
