    Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought. \\ \medskip

\begin{center}
Every honest researcher I know admits he's just a professional amateur.
He's doing whatever he's doing for the first time. That makes him an amateur.
He has sense enough to know that he's going to have a lot of trouble,
so that makes him a professional.\\ \medskip
--- Charles F. Kettering (1876-1958) (Holder of 186 patents)
