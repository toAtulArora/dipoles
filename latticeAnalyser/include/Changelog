   * Fixed REPORT_LEN for Windoze. It has to be larger by  one  on  PC
     end to allow for dummy report id. On Windoze full REPORT_LEN data
     bytes are transferred. On Linux the number of bytes sent  can  be
     samller than  REPORT_LEN,  which  is  more  efficient.  Thus,  on
     Windoze, data has to framed and the actual length of  valid  data
     sent along with the frame to figure out, at  the  receiving  end,
     the number of valid data bytes.

	* Added test description to the file header of main.c
   * Function nWriteUSB( S8Bit *) changed to nWriteUSB(S8Bit *, U8Bit)
     with length of data  string  to  be  sent  to  muC  passed  as  a
     parameter. This is to take care of cases where  the  data  string
     written contains a null character.
